## Self-Hosting
We do not recommend self-hosting the bot and website, but it's always an option.

### Self-host Discord bot
To selfhost the bot yourself, you need to have:
* Node - confirmed working on v17.0.1
* npm - comes with Node, the version shouldn't really matter
* A Discord bot token, and having the bot in your server
* An mongodb.com-database set up, as well as a user to it (with write access)
* A clone of the source code, this can be found [here](https://github.com/SiebeBaree/Coinz) and needs to be extracted to a folder.

We will have to do this once:
* Do `npm i` inside the folder, and wait for it to finish.
* Create a file `.env` in the root of the folder.
* Change `/src/config.json` with your default values.

**Example .env file:** *(Do not use `""` or `''`)*
```
TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
DATABASE_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/
```

After all this, start the bot with `npm run start`.

### Self-host Website
To selfhost the website yourself, you need to have:
* Python - confirmed working on v3.9.7
* pip - comes with Python, the version shouldn't really matter (at least 2.x)
* OAuth2 Redirects setup (You can find the OAuth2 tab in your discord application)
* All packages installed (List of all packages in `/website/requirements.txt`)
* A clone of the source code, this can be found [here](https://github.com/SiebeBaree/Coinz) and needs to be extracted to a folder.

We will have to do this once:
* Rename `example.config.py` to `config.py`.
* Change `config.py` with your default values.

**OAuth2 Redirects:** *(For local testing change `https://www.your-website-here.com` to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`)*
```
https://www.your-website-here.com/callback
https://www.your-website-here.com/dashboard
```

After all this, run `python3 website/coinzbot.py`.

> ### âš  Warning 
> There is literally no warranty if you self-host Coinz, and we will not help you set it up either. If you wish to set the bot and/or website up yourself, we expect you have well enough knowledge in Node.js and Python.
