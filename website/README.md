If you can't/don't want to donate, that's fine. You can also support Coinz by starring or forking this repository. To make this bot even better consider opening a pull request or issue with a new feature.

## Self-Hosting
We do not recommend self-hosting the bot and website, but it's always an option.

To selfhost the website yourself, you need to have:
* Python - confirmed working on v3.9.10
* pip - comes with Python, the version shouldn't really matter (at least 2.x)
* OAuth2 Redirects setup (You can find the OAuth2 tab in your discord application)
* All packages installed (List of all packages in `/website/requirements.txt`)
* A clone of the source code, this can be found [here](https://github.com/SiebeBaree/Coinz) and needs to be extracted to a folder.

We will have to do this once:
* Create a file in `website/` named `.env`.
* Change `website/.env` with your values.

**OAuth2 Redirects:**
```
https://www.your-website-here.com/callback
https://www.your-website-here.com/dashboard
```

**Example website/.env file:** *(Do not use `""` or `''`)*
```
APP_SECRET_KEY=
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=
```

After all this, run `python3 website/coinzbot.py`.

> ### âš  Warning 
> There is literally no warranty if you self-host Coinz, and we will not help you set it up either. If you wish to set the bot and/or website up yourself, we expect you have well enough knowledge in Python, Flask, HTML/CSS, Mongodb, ... .
